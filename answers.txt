Answers to exercises G1--G3:

G1: 
- Informally, what does the command above do?
	This command searches all files in the current directory and prints out each line that contains the term "smutex";
- Paste the first few lines of the output into answers.txt
	./sthread.cpp:void smutex_init(smutex_t *mutex)
	./sthread.cpp:void smutex_destroy(smutex_t *mutex)
	./sthread.cpp:void smutex_lock(smutex_t *mutex)
	./sthread.cpp:void smutex_unlock(smutex_t *mutex)
	./sthread.cpp:void scond_signal(scond_t *cond, smutex_t *mutex __attribute__((unused)))
	./sthread.cpp:void scond_broadcast(scond_t *cond, smutex_t *mutex __attribute__((unused)))
	...

G2:
- What command can you use to search the file RequestGenerator.cpp for Task objects?
	grep "Task" RequestGenerator.cpp
- What command can you use to search all header files for the keyword return?
	grep -r "return" *.h

G3:
	This command searches all the files in the current directory and prints out each line that contain smutex type methods, it has to be specified with "smutex" plus parameters parentheses.
	The results show all the smutex methods listed in the header file that should be implemented by sthread.cpp file.
